- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-RES-007-002

The platform shall preserve result history, amendments, signatures and delivery evidence.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-RES-007-003

The platform shall enforce clinical approval and authorization rules before publishing notificaciones.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
