## Functional Requirements

### FR-PLT-007-001

The platform shall provide secure, auditable and configurable auditoría as a shared platform capability.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-PLT-007-002

The platform shall enforce tenant, laboratory and branch isolation for auditoría.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-PLT-007-003

The platform shall expose Audit Trail through APIs and reusable services without coupling business domains to providers.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-PLT-007-004

The platform shall support monitoring, auditability and operational reporting for auditoría.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-PLT-007-005

The platform shall remain cloud-agnostic, compute-agnostic and on-premise compatible for Audit Trail.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.
