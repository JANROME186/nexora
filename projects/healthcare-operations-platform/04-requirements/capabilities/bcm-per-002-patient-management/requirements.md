The platform shall manage master data for gestión de pacientes, avoiding duplicate person records across roles.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
- Given invalid or incomplete data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform rejects it with a standardized error response.
- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-PER-002-002

The platform shall support search, registration, update, deactivation and audit of gestión de pacientes.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.

- Given a successful state change, when the transaction is completed, then the platform publishes or records the corresponding domain event when applicable.

### FR-PER-002-003

The platform shall validate identity, contact and demographic data according to country-pack rules when applicable.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given an authorized user, when the action is performed, then the platform validates permissions before executing it.
- Given valid input data, when the transaction is submitted, then the platform persists the change and records audit metadata.
